A1: Oh man me and Connie just  ([3.875]BackHandBeats_Spread1_ExemplarSet_NeffDec1,2H[0.49])  got back from the most buff macho manly camping trip in the woods ever!!

B1: Ever since we were ([9.367]WeighOptions_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.60]/Calm_High_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.54])  five our dads take us camping, and let me tell y'all whose tent was the brightest  ([13.879]DrawHouse_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.95])  tent ever, that's right mine, it even out shone Henry's, but ([17.465]Wipe_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.46])  that's so you know we'd have a point of  ([18.887]Chide_Hand_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,RH[0.30])  reference if any of us got lost in the night times when there are scary things around and the portapotty seems like a million   ([24.901]rub_forehead2_NeuroticAdaptors,RH[1.17])  miles away.

A2: I reckon he even saved us from a ([27.469]WeighOptions_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.60])  couple bears one night, and no it wasn't with screaming, it was a very manly go away ([32.958]Beat1_ShakesAngry3_FingerSkel,2H[0.23])  bear call, or should that be repellent?!

B2: They can  ([35.913]Beat1_ShakesAngry3_FingerSkel,2H[0.23]/Beat12_ShakesAngry3_FingerSkel,RH[0.47])  smell blood you know!! Which for once ([37.790]Wipe_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.46])  wasn't mine because this year I wasn't allowed the knife.

A3: Either way he  ([41.540]Calm_High_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.54])  saved us once again, the great and ([43.545]SweepSide2_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,LH[0.51])  fearsome, Schuyler Carson, to the rescue!

B3: Connie and my dad  ([47.505]ShyCalm_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.33])  did some canoeing, but me and Henry figured some one had to ([50.615]Calm_High_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.54]/Cup3_AntonyTired_2H[0.11])  stay behind and make lunch AND smores

A4: So  ([52.936]PointingSelfPerson_ShakesTired2_FingerSkel,RH[0.84])  I ended up making the lunch and he made the smores which I ([56.154]Shrug_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.57]/Beat1_ShakesAngry3_FingerSkel,2H[0.23]))  supervised just in case he burnt himself, I would have helped but as the saying goes too many campers spoil the smores.

B4: I even   ([63.889]Beat_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.17])  came back with rugged manly stubble, I know contain yourselves, ([67.819]PointingSelfPerson_ShakesTired2_FingerSkel,RH[0.84]/ShortRegressive_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10, 2H[0.34])  y'all can have a stroke, just form an orderly queue to come touch it. So my rugged beard is clearly a far ([73.819]Shrug_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.57) better souvenir than swollen up bug bites, like my dad has

A5: You know they must have been killer mosquitos…([79.833]PointingSelfPerson_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,RH[0.41]/Cup3_AntonyTired,2H[0.11])  I am glad I didn't stay in his tent like usual.

B5: That did mean however that I ([84.234]BackHandBeats_Spread1_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.49])  got to drive us all home, which was cool, although his car is not a lot like my beatle, so ([89.616]PointingSelfPerson_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,RH[0.41])  I was a bit shakey at first, but hey we all arrived home in one piece so it's fine!
