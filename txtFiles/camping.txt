A1: Jay, Matt, and I went  ([3.988]Abandoned_TrainTired,2H[0.30])  camping this weekend. We were well provisioned, Matt had ([7.545]ShortRegressive_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.34])  everything you could think of for the trip: a huge tent, hotdogs, marshmellows, coolers, everclear, vodka, a ([14.745]Umbrella_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.50])  watermelon plugged with everclear, among other things. 

B1: Ugh, the  ([18.960]NervousTwitch1_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10, 2H[0.27])  everclear ended up being too much for us, and Jay and I were both holding our stomachs before long. ([25.293]Umbrella_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.50]/Beat5_ShakesAngry3_FingerSkel,2H[0.81])  Watermelon did little to soften the effect, but it was amusing watching them attempt to keep a straight face as they bit into it.

A2: Yeah.. In all honesty, I was ([33.919]NervousTwitch1_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.27]/PointingAbstract2_AirplaneAngry,LH[0.57])  probably more amusing to watch, but I managed to force down a piece. Unfortunately, I had gotten a piece particularly ([41.361]Erruptive1_ShakesTired2_FingerSkel,2H[0.43])  close to the plug.Â 

B2: We took a long swim over to the rope swing where we met up with some ([46.191]Cup3_AntonyTired,2H[0.10]/Beat1_TrainTired,RH[0.50])  crazy guys shooting fireworks into the water. After nearly hitting me, they apologized, but ([51.550]Erruptive_Vert_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.29])  x continued lighting the fireworks, anyway.

A3: We eventually climbed out of the water to join them and the ([57.328]Cup3_AntonyTired,2H[0.10])  craziness that ensued left us all with at least one close encounter with a  ([62.426]Box_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.95])  bottle rocket (or in some cases, straight on hits) and exchanging phone numbers before the day was over.

B3: I think we  ([69.424] Progressive_ShakesTired2_FingerSkel,2H[0.97])  probably would have hung out longer right? but they got really drunk and ([73.156]rub_forehead1_NeuroticAdaptors,RH[0.56])  left for a park in order to pick a fight with some guy that had keyed one of their cars.

A4: Yeah so we came back that night and played a few ([80.341]Cup_Vert_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.54])  rounds of cards. Matt ([81.774]BackHandBeats_Spread1_ExemplarSet_NeffDec1,2H[0.49])  got completely trashed

B4: He's  ([83.534]RaisedIndexfinger_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,RH[0.40])  one of those that will repeatedly tell you he's not drunk, ([86.439]Cup_Vert_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.54]/Erruptive_Vert_ExemplarSet_NeffDec10,2H[0.29])  over and over again, and that's when you know he's pretty far gone!
